# Act:
Recommendations from gained insights:
* **Promote Jackets More**: Jackets are the top performers in both volume and revenue. Zara could expand the collection and focus on promoting them to maximize returns.
* **Revamp Jeans**: Jeans consistently underperform. Introducing new styles or testing lower-priced options could help boost sales.
* **Try New Promotions for Medium/Low-Priced Items**: Promotions don’t seem to drive revenue for medium and low-priced items. Zara should test different promo strategies like bundling or discounts.
* **Focus Promotions on Shoes**: Shoes perform better with promotions. Running more seasonal or limited-time offers could drive more sales in this category.
* **Target Low-Price Items**: Sweaters and T-shirts do well in the low-price range. Zara could try “Buy One, Get One Free” or limited-time deals to boost sales.
* **Highlight Medium-Price Jackets**: Jackets sell best in the medium price range. Zara should feature these in marketing to attract mid-range shoppers
* **Reconsider Promotion Strategy for Jeans**: Jeans do better without promotions. Zara might want to focus on improving product variety or other strategies to drive sales without discounts.
